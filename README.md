# Motion Design Agency

[Live Demo](#) https://motiondesignagency.netlify.app

This project is a Motion Design Agency website created using **React** and
**Tailwind CSS**. It was inspired by the design and functionality of the
[1600.Agency](https://1600.agency) website, aiming to replicate its aesthetic
and user experience.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project was for learning and training purposes. It
serves as a practical application of my skills in modern web development,
focusing on responsive design, component-based architecture, and the use of
utility-first CSS with Tailwind.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless
  experience across devices.
- **Dynamic Components**: Built with React, the site features reusable
  components for efficient development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind for styling, allowing for rapid design
  changes and a clean, modern look.
